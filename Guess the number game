# This is a simple number guessing game.
# The program asks the user to choose a maximum number,
# then randomly selects a secret number between 0 and that maximum.
# The user is prompted to guess the number until they get it right.
# If the guess is not a valid number, the program asks again.
# When the correct number is guessed, the game congratulates the user and ends.
