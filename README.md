# Projects-
This repository is a series of projects that helped me develop my coding abilities from the most basic skills (like printing, if statements, while loops etc) to more developed concepts.
1) Capital-quizz game -> my first ever project. It covers basic concepts such as string manipulation, if statements
2) Guess the number game -> very simple guessing game that taught me how to ask the user to choose a maximum number then the user gets prompted to choose based on if the number is lower/higher
3) Rock/Paper/Scissors game -> a very simple game that enabled me to test my thinking on generating random numbers and making the user choose a variable
4) Story game -> just letting the user make some choices and based on their answer then the story continues or stops
