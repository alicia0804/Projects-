# Projects-
This repository is a series of projects that helped me develop my coding abilities from the most basic skills (like printing, if statements, while loops etc) to more developed concepts.
1) Capital-quizz game -> my first ever project. It covers basic concepts such as string manipulation, if statements
2) Guess the number game -> very simple guessing game that taught me how to ask the user to choose a maximum number then the user gets prompted to choose based on if the number is lower/higher
3) Rock/Paper/Scissors game -> a very simple game that enabled me to test my thinking on generating random numbers and making the user choose a variable
4) Story game -> just letting the user make some choices and based on their answer then the story continues or stops
5) Password Manager -> built a password manager in Python using Fernet encryption; stores and retrieves encrypted credentials from a local file.
6) Dice game -> between multiple players that are able to roll the dice to get a number of points, their points are canceled if they land on 1
7) Storytxt Game -> replacing words in different stories and printing the complete story
8) Mah Game -> this small game generates 10 arithmetic problems using addition, multiplication, substraction, the player is timed from start to finish and must answer the question correctly
